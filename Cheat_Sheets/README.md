- Cheat sheet 1: (5/5) Looks like you covered everything! Just a couple of small notes. Python can be used outside of an IDE (or editor, generally) but this is not very common. And, although VSCode has a lot of features from IDEs it usually is just referred to as a basic editor. Personally I don't think the difference is large, but just wanted to note.
